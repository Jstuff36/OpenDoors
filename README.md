## Minimum Viable Product

OpenDoors is a web application meant to connect travelers looking for a room with locals wanting to open their doors to the world. It is built using Ruby on Rails and React.js and is a clone of the popular sight [Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/).

following criteria with smooth, bug-free navigation, adequate seed data and
sufficient CSS styling:
- [ ] Hosting on Heroku
- [ ] New account creation, login, and guest/demo login
- [ ] A production README, replacing this README
- [ ] Spots
- [ ] Bookings
- [ ] Spots search (by location & availability) & Google Maps on search
- [ ] Reviews
