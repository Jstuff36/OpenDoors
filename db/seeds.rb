# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# user: {email: "myemail", password: "password", firstname: "justin", lastname: "white", city: "Cucuta", country: "Colombia", location: [8, 72.5]}
